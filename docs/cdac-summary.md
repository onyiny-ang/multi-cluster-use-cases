# Statically Distribute an Application Consistently across all Clusters
 
For this use case we want to ensure that an application is running in the exact same way (number of replicas, size, scale) on every cluster that is joined to the federation control plane.
Upon setting up the federation control plane with one cluster designated as the host (using kubefed init), the kubefed command makes the realization of this use case very straight forward. Each cluster is joined to the federation control plane using the kubefed join command. Once this structure is set up, all deployments made on the host cluster are cascaded to each of the joined clusters such that each cluster is ostensibly a clone of the host. The apparent simplicity of this set up is complicated by persistent data storage. At this point there is no support for federated persistent data. The host cluster can be made with its own persistent volume that can be propagated out to each cluster but there is no automatic communication between these clusters or persistence across clusters. That is not to say that communication between clusters is impossible, just that it involves a few extra steps (example with mongodb on pacman: https://github.com/font/k8s-example-apps/blob/master/pacman-nodejs-app/docs/pacman-nodejs-app-federated-multicloud.md#create-mongodb-persistent-volume-claims).
Static distribution of an application can be deployed consistently across multiple cloud providers which helps customers to avoid vendor lock-in.
